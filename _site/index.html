<h1 id="about"><a name="about"></a>About</h1>

<p>Hi all! I’m Doug! I’m a PhD student (soon to defend my thesis) in oceanography and I like to learn and teach. As a way to scratch the itch to teach, I’ve started writing books to help others learn seemingly very challenging and advanced topics in the fields of science and engineering, like Calculus, Partial Differentiation, and/or Vibrations (maybe even a touch of Thermodynamics or Fluid Mechanics sometime). And while the different books that I’m writing will be intended for different starting levels of knowledge, the point of these books are to help those who want to learn and to learn these complex topics <em>by themselves</em>.</p>

<p>A lot of the introductory textbooks for topics in science and engineering are typically made to go along with a course at a university, not as the sole resource for an autodidact. Sure, to the already enlightened they may seem full enough to understand the topic without an instructor, but, a lot of the time, they skip steps with the expectation that an instructor will fill in the gaps. That’s not what I’m doing here. Here, in these books, I am giving you all the information needed to lead you through the work as though <em>the text itself was the instructor</em>. And by doing so, opening up the world of science and engineering to those who don’t necessarily want to go to university to learn a topic or to those who want a better resource to teach themselves, by themselves.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Oh and if you’re wondering what the logo and name is all about, yéil is the Tlingit word for raven. Ravens are known for their intelligence, and unlike in more western culture where they are typically associated with death, in the cultures of the Indigenous peoples of Pacific Northwest, the raven is associated with creation (and sometimes a little trickery). And, well, here we’re trying to create and promote knowledge, so it only seems fitting.</p>
